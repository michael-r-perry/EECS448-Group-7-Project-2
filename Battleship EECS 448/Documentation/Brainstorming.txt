Special Shot

Splash and Explosion animations/sounds

The ability to move a ship as your turn during the shooting phase (probably way too impractical)

A limited-use scanner that either reveals the contents of an area or just that there's a ship within it

If a player gets multiple hit in a row, they gain access to a shot that hits a whole row

Powerups you can place on your board that give a benefit when the enemy player shoots them


Implementation:
----Add AI class
----Add AI property to ShipDriver class
----Add ifAI bool to ShipDriver class to be used
----Choose if AI and difficulty in ShipDriver::SetUpBoard
--------If AI chosen it will instantiate property there
--------As well as set ifAI bool to true
