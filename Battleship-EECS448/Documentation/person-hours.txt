Project 1:

Given how much we all worked on this project the last week, we estimate our person-hours to be around 20-25 hours worked.
We came to this conclusion based on the fact that we all have experience writing in C++, so it should not take more than 25 hours for us to complete a project of this size.

In actuality, our total number of person-hours worked is broken down as follows:
James: 3 hours 9/12, 1 hour 9/14, 3 hours 9/15, 2 hours 9/16, 2 hours 9/18, 1 hour 9/19
	   Total: 12 hours
Konrad: 1.25 hours 9/13, 0.66 hours 9/14, 0.34 hours 9/16, 3.34 hours 9/17, 1 hour 9/18
	   Total: 6.60 hours
Paul: 1.5 hours 9/14, 0.75 hours 9/15, 0.34 hours 9/16, 0.34 hours 9/17
	   Total: 2.93 hours
Cole: 3 hours 9/15, 1 hour 9/16, 3 hours 9/17, 0.5 hours 9/18
	   Total: 7.5 hours

Grand Total: 29.03 person-hours
