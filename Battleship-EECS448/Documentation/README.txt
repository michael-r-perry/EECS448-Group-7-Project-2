Starting the Game:
	After starting the game in the main menu, the player will have the choice of choosing between 1-6 ships that will be in play.

Placing Ships:
	Player 1 begins by placing their 1x1 ship on the board. They will be prompted with which orientation they would like their ship to be,
	then they must input a coordinate with an example given on how to format their coordinate. 
	Horizontal ships go to the right from the given coordinate while vertical ships go up from the given coordinate.  
	Player 1 continues placing their ships until all ships have been placed.
	A prompt will notify Player 1 that the screen will switch to Player 2 who will begin placing their ships.
	Once both players have placed all of their ships on the board, the game will begin.

Playing the Game:
	Player 1 starts first. They will see their board and where their ships are located on the top of the screen, and a stripped-down version of their opponent's board
	that will only show Hits and Misses below. Player 1 begins by making a guess. They will be informed if the coordinate was a hit or miss and the board will
	be updated as such.
	After making their guess, players will swap seats and press any key to switch to Player 2's view. 
	Both players keep making guesses until a winner is declared, in which case the program terminates.
